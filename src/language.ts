Artifacts are NFTs of items the collection is storing. Since the artifacts are stored on Arweave, they cannot be changed or removed in any way by anyone.<br><br>This is the continuation of the dream that was the Great Library of Alexandria. In order for us to move forward and continue making better decisions we need the ability to clearly see our past.<br><br><b>Alex.</b><br><br>Always accessible. Never changing. Never deleted.`,
