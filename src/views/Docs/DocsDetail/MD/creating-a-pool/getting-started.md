# Getting started

This documentation allows anyone to start their own pool and earn $AR. For a more high level overview of the Alex. Archive, please visit our [about page](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/about).

An Arweave wallet is needed to deploy your pool. You can get one here:

- [ArConnect](https://arconnect.io)

## Pool creation methods

1. **User Interface** - Create a pool from the Alex user interface from the [Pool Creation Page](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/pools/create).
2. **Alex. CLI (arcpool)** - Create a pool with the command line interface that supports all archiving sources.
