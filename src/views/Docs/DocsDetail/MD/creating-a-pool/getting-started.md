# Getting Started

This documentation allows anyone to start their own pool and earn $AR. For a more high level overview of the Alex. Archive, please visit our [about page](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/about).

## Requirements

**arcpool** requires [NodeJS (v18+)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.

An Arweave web wallet with a small amount of $AR on it is needed to deploy your pool. You can get one here:
