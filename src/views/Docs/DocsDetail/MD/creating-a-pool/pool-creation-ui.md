# Creating a pool from the UI

Start by connecting your wallet and filling out the pool information [here](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/pools/create).

Once you have created your pool and visit the individual Pool Manage Page located in the Pools tab in your account, you can now upload files to your pool. Please note that file metadata uploaded is permanent, so donâ€™t forget to double check metadata.

## UI to CLI configuration

If you would like to use mining sources not supported in the user interface, then you can download your pool configuration (pools.json) file to your local. To do this you must visit the Pools tab in your account and locate the pool that you created.

After visiting that individual pool page, you must click 'Download Pool Configuration' to download the pools.json file.

Next you will need to create a wallets directory in the same directory as the pools.json file that holds the wallet keyfile that owns the pool. You must then update the walletPath in pools.json to point to that wallet.

Once the pools.json file is configured withthe correct wallet information, follow the steps in [mining artifacts](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/docs/creating-a-pool/mining-artifacts) to archive from other sources.
