# Core concepts

#### Keywords and foundations of the Alex. Archive

- **Pool**: a topic, event, or idea that can be digitally and publicly archived.
- **Artifact**: Permanently preserved digital content that can be documents, books, images, audio, or videos. Artifacts are deployed as assets to Arweave and distributed to the contributors based on the amount of $AR contributed to a pool.
- **Pool operator**: A user that creates and runs a pool that mines artifacts for a topic/event/idea of their choice. The pool operator earns $AR by declaring a percentage of the contributions to be kept.
- **Pool contributor**: A user that contributes $AR to a pool in order to store artifacts on Arweave and pay the pool operator for doing the work of mining artifacts. Pool contributors receive artifacts sent to their wallet for their contributions.
