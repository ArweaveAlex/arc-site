# Contributing to a pool

The Alex. Platform is developed in such a way so that anyone can contribute to preserving digital content. To contribute to a pool, you must navigate to the [pools page](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/pools), find a pool that you would like to contribute to, and click the contribute button.

A popup screen will appear that requires you to connect your wallet and indicate how much $ you would like to contribute to a pool. Contributions are handled through [Turbo](https://ardrive.io/turbo-bundler/), which is a payment service that bridges fiat currency to $AR. After selecting how much to contribute, you can complete the payment through the Stripe popup.

Once this transaction is settled, the pool page will show the new total contributed $AR. Now once the pool operator continues to mine artifacts, your wallet will receive an equal percentage of artifacts to the amount of $AR contributed to the pool.

- For example: If John contributed 10 $AR tokens and the total amount contributed was 100 $AR tokens, John will receive 10% of the mined artifacts into his wallet.
