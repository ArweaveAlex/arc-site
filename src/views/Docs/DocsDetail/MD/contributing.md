# Contributing to a pool

The Alex platform is developed in such a way so that anyone can contribute to preserving digital content. To contribute to a pool, you must navigate to the [pool page](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/pools) and click the contribute button.

A popup screen will appear that requires you to connect your wallet and indicate how much $AR you would like to contribute.

Once this transaction is settled, the pool page will show the new total contributed $AR. Now once the pool operator continues to mine artifacts, your wallet will receive an equal percentage of artifacts to the amount of $AR contributed to the pool.

- For example: If John contributed 10 $AR tokens and the total amount contributed was 100 $AR tokens, John will receive 10% of the mined artifacts into his wallet.
