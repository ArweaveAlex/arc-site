# Accessing artifacts

Now that you have successfully contributed $AR to a pool, you will receive an equal percentage (of total $AR) of artifacts sent to your wallet.

To access these artifact sponsorships, navigate to your account in the top right corner and select “artifacts”. On your account page, you can browse through and interact with your artifacts.

Use [ArProfile](https://arprofile.arweave.dev/ target="\_blank") to make a social profile, with a profile picture, @handle, bio and social media links.
