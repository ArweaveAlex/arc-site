# Access artifacts

Now that you have successfully contributed $AR to a pool, you will receive an equal percentage (of total $AR) of artifacts sent to your wallet.

To access these artifacts, you must connect your wallet on the Alex site. From there you can navigate to your account. Use [ArProfile](https://arprofile.arweave.dev/) to make a social profile, with a profile picture, @handle, bio and social media links.

On your account page, you can browse through and interact with your artifacts.
