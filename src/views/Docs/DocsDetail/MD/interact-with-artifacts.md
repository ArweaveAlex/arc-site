# Interacting with artifacts

While browsing through artifacts on Alex. you can STAMP, share, and fact check.

To STAMP an artifact means to give it a ‘like’. [Stamps](https://stamps.live/) are the universal ‘like’ button on all permaweb apps. Stamped artifacts along with all other stamped permaweb content is displayed on [now](https://now.arweave.dev/).

Sharing artifacts is also easy within the platform. You can copy the Artifact link, Artifact ID, or share the Artifact link on Twitter.

If you find yourself questioning the truthfulness of an artifact, you can ‘support’ or ‘oppose’ it by opening a Fact Market. [Fact Markets](https://facts.g8way.io/#/) are a new form of online quality checks that encourage community discourse to support or oppose assertions.
