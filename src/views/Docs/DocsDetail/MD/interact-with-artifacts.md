# Interacting with artifacts

You can share, STAMP or sell artifacts from the artifact pages or from the account page.

## Share

Sharing artifacts is easy within the platform. You can copy the artifact link, artifact ID, or share the artifact link on X.

## STAMP

Stamps are the universal ‘like’ button on all permaweb apps. Stamped artifacts along with all other stamped permaweb content is displayed on other permaweb applications such as [now.arweave.dev](https://now.arweave.dev/) and [BazAR](https://bazar.arweave.dev/#/).

## Sell

Artifact sponsorships can be traded on the [Universal Content Marketplace](https://ucm-wiki.g8way.io/#/en/main) (UCM) protocol. BazAR is the first user interface built on the UCM and can be accessed [here](https://bazar.arweave.dev/#/). Artifacts can be traded on the UCM either individually or through collections.
