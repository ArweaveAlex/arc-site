# Introducing the Alex Archive

Alex. is a decentralized, community-supported archive that leverages permanent data storage technology to ensure knowledge and history can endure indefinitely without fear of censorship, alteration, or deletion. The name draws inspiration from the Great Library of Alexandria, tragically lost in 48 B.C., which held thousands of ancient historical records. Alex. strives to build the new Library of Alexandria on [Arweave](https://arweave.org/).

Learn more about the Alex. platform in this post.

## How Alex. Works

Alex. operates as a community archiving platform open to anyone interested in either archiving or contributing storage space for archives. These archives, known as **pools**, cover diverse topics, events, or ideas that individuals wish to preserve. The person that creates a pool is called the **pool operator**, and they are the person that uploads digital content to the pool. Further details on archival pools can be found [here](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/create/).

Once a pool is created, other users known as **contributors**, interested in supporting the topic can donate $AR in the form of [Ardrive Turbo](https://ardrive.io/turbo-bundler/) credits, covering storage costs on Arweave.

With storage space contributed, the pool operator can begin uploading content. Contributors, in return for their storage space contribution, receive sponsorship credit for a portion of the uploaded content, known as **artifact sponsorships**. Essentially, contributors become sponsors of 1/1 pieces of digital history that can be collected and [traded](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/trade/). For example, the below article covering the recent Bitcoin rally is a unique piece of digital history. The artifact sponsor can trade the sponsorship on [BazAR](https://bazar.arweave.dev/#/asset/NMLa6zeVZERWyPM9Nzwl36IHIktXgxY-NqXihn6BVEk).

This incentivizes more archiving from historians and contributions from community members, fostering collaborative participation. Unlike the current archiving model, where the data owner bears the cost, Alex. allows the public to sponsor digital content archiving in an engaging, collaborative platform.

## The importance of permanent archives

Throughout history, controlling information distribution has been crucial for authoritarian regimes to maintain power. Inspired by dystopian literature like 1984 and nonfiction accounts under authoritarian regimes such as The Gulag Archipelago, Man’s Search for Meaning, and The Aquariums of Pyongyang, Arweave was founded. It ensures the preservation of the world's knowledge in a permanent and immutable network.

The Alex. Archive was established to make this dream of archiving the world’s knowledge a reality. All artifacts on Alex. are stored on Arweave and secured by a decentralized network of [miners](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/arweave-mining) incentivized to store and replicate the dataset to earn rewards. These rewards are funded by a [sustainable endowment](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/storage-endowment), guaranteeing data availability on Arweave and, consequently, from Alex.

**The best aspect of this data storage model is that anyone can store data forever with a single, one-time fee.**

## Community archives as a public good

The Alex Archive is a fully decentralized and open-source project. All [source code](https://github.com/ArweaveAlex) for the mining tools and website, is stored on Arweave and available to the public. Our team values transparency and collaboration with the community. We even offer a 30 $AR [bounty](https://github.com/ArweaveAlex/arc-pools/blob/main/bounty.md) for those who successfully implement new mining tools benefiting pool operators.

As Alex. is a decentralized application, no personal data about users is stored. Essentially, Alex. is a static user interface built on the [permaweb](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/the-permaweb) (Arweave’s data lake), accessed by connecting the user's Arweave wallet to the platform. This ensures that all users maintain control over their online data while interacting with the Alex. platform.

## What’s next for Alex?

Since the early release in November 2022, we've pushed the boundaries of decentralized archiving. Our community has archived over 7 million pieces of digital content onto Arweave, archiving current events, historical topics, and even public domain books.

Our next steps focus on enhancing the user experience for both pool operators and contributors, improving asset discoverability, and bridging the gap between the historical/archiving community and the technical crypto community with better tooling and educational resources.

### Specific updates on our agenda include:

- Migrating all new archival pools and artifacts onto [AO](https://ao.arweave.dev/).
- Enabling pool operators to edit and customize pool pages.
- Introducing multi-wallet operated pools.
- Implementing automated mining in the UI.

## How to get involved

Now that you understand how the Alex. Archive operates and why community archiving is a public good, you may be eager to get involved. If interested in starting an archival pool, we recommend checking out the [pool info page](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/create/) and technical [docs](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/docs/introduction). Additionally, we have a [contribute info page](https://alex.arweave.dev/#/contribute/) for those interested in contributing to existing pools.

For more information on how to get involved with Alex. and answers to any further questions, feel free to join our project [Discord](http://discord.gg/2uZsWuTNvN). There you can connect with the Alex. team, ask questions, promote your pool, and share interesting archived content with the Arweave archiving community.
